# Smart-EV-System
 A Smart EV System using a Gyroscope Sensor detects the angle of the vehicle on hilly terrain.  When the sensor detects a steep incline or decline, it automatically turns off the air conditioning, fog lamps, and music system  to save energy. This helps conserve power and improve the efficiency of the electric vehicle in hilly areas.
